I have just reached (with this commit!!!) my 1000th commit this year, basically
from January. 
This seems a trivial milestone to celebrate, however in the past few months
I have been trying to go public as soon as possible and the numbers are a good
signal that this is happening. Let's see if I'll be able to achieve 2000 by the
end of the year!
