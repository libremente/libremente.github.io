What is a *MOOC*?

MOOC stands for Massive Open Online Courseware, one of the latest trends in the
world of eLearning. What does that mean? 
Basically the following:

- Massive: both the platform (and the contents) are designed in order to scale
  from few users to several thousands, all accessing at the same time. 
- Open: free for all, just tune in and get your class without paying any fee!
- Online: it lives over the Internet!
- Courseware: the contents are materials specifically designed in order to be
  delivered in an online class. 

Now, do you see any flaws in this?

Unfortunately I see some, especially regarding the third dot: what if the
*connection* does not exist?

Many educational institution over the Italian territory still do not have
a proper Internet connection and this makes the availability of web tools
completely useless since they cannot be accessed from the place where education
is created. Is there a way to solve this? Clearly, providing a decent Internet
access to the people that truly need it should be at the top of the
government's to-do list but what should we do in the meanwhile?

With this post I would like to introduce ***BOOC***, which is the ***Box*** for ***Open***,
***Offline***, ***Courseware*** distribution. 

From the name it may be possible to understand what this is all about but both 
the hardware and the software will be illustrated as soon as possible on this
platform. Stay tuned!
