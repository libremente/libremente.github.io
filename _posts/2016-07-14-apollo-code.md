The Apollo 11 code has been released on
[Github](https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11). 
It's a lot of assembly, I had some fun trying to understand some procedures.
It's also cool to see some of the comments inserted like the following:

``` assembly
ELFCHK      TC  SMODECHK    # ** CHARLEY, COME IN HERE
```

hackers... they are all alike! :)
