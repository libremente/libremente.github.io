Bitcoin (BTC) is undoubtedly the hot topic of the moment. 

It seems clear that we are in a bubble but nobody is really understanding
whether it will pop soon or not. 
With the recent entrance of the CME in the game giving the possibility to trade
futures, all the major trading platforms treating cryptocurrencies experienced
some problems. 
Many people, when the following is displayed, panic: is this just temporary?

Will my coins be safe? What will happen? How much time will it take to fix
this?
Unfortunately just the Coinbase team is able to give a reasonable reply, all we
can do is check their [status](https://status.coinbase.com/) webpage to track
what situation they are dealing with right now. 
The load is high, it was easy to predict this behaviour but, if you really care
about your coins, then don't leave them online, but download and store them
offline if possible. If you want to hold them (HODL!) then that is the best
idea. You have to be aware that if you want to trade them quickly you should
rely on the infrastructure's policies regarding security of the wallet so this
might be riskier given all the DDOS attacks that run daily against those
infrastructure.

I don't want to give direct suggestions but if you believe in BTC and you want
to hold them for long then store them offline and keep just low amounts of
currency online if you want to quickly trade it. 

Calculate your risks!
