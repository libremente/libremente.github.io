Yet another post on new year's resolutions. 
Actually I am writing it just to keep track of my achievements and see what
happens in the following months. 

So here it is...

* **Refactor** my development setup. Standing desk, new monitors, new keyboard,
  new laptop are ready to shine. 
* **Publish** all the code I developed locally. It's a lot of code which may be
  useful for the community. I want to find some spare time to refactor it, fill it
  with documentation and make it as easy as possible to quickly see it in
  action.
* **Speed up** the development cycle. Many times I find myself working with people
  who don't know what a VM is (don't even think about `vagrant` or `docker`)
  and I believe that seeing code written in `/var/www/` in 2018 is a avoidable
  pain. So my resolution here is to stress the use of some sort of
  ''containers'' which make it possible to ship faster and collaborate being
  able to reproduce the same environment.
* **Learn** TDD and Dynamic Programming. This is something I started to study many
  times but never tried in a real world use case. I believe in it, and I think
  it may be a good deal to foster it more. 
* **Contribute** to FOSS projects more. Which translated in polishing and pushing
  some patches I've already done for a set of programs locally and find more
  interesting projects to contribute to. 
* **Donate** to FOSS projects. I will continue to do it as much as possible. 
* **Read** more. My next buy will be the latest release of ''Two Scoops of Django''.

Let's see what can I do in this 2018! :)
