The first thing I do in the morning is checking [ANSA](https://ansa.it), which
is one of the most important Italian news agencies. 
What I like about such agency is the format of the news: I think it provides 
a reasonable amount of information in a decent amount of display space. A good
compromise.
However, *every morning*, I spot typos somewhere in the text. I am shocked
about this since, in 2018, it looks a bit strange to me how something can go
live on a website ranked as the 4th most followed brand in Italy by [Reuters](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Digital%20News%20Report%202017%20web_0.pdf?utm_source=Direct).

I should dig further in order to understand how this can possibly happen.
I guess there is no revision time since they want the exclusivity of the
articles but what happens with the embedded checker? I believe they will use
an online form to insert posts. I guess their CMS has an internal corrector in
place, most WYSIWYG editors, also the free ones, have it nowadays. 
So let's imagine a typical workflow: 
* the reporter quickly writes the article using his office automation tool.
* Afterwards, he/she logs in the CMS and copy-pastes it in the form.
* Push send.
This would mean that a double check should work.
At this point, seeing the amount of articles, I believe there is not a third
party reviewing the article if not all the easy-to-spot errors should not
appear in the live version.

Now, if two checks are not enough, is there a way to prevent this from
happening again? Should the CMS stop and ask for a review of each error? Should
it change color of the text or put a big red box behind it? But, most
importantly, do people really care about this problem or it's just me?
Personally, when I see such trivial typos in articles I immediately think the
credibility of the whole journal is undermined. But, again, maybe it's just my
way of seeing things. 

PS: this article before being pushed goes through an
`aspell --lang=en check` process. If you can still spot mistakes please excuse
me and let me know (after all, I am not a news agency, I should be allowed to
make mistakes) :).
