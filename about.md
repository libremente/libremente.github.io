Some people ask me what and why.

Well, I believe it's just about opening a simple text editor (offline!), drop
some lines and whenever a cable is available... 

```
gg (git status)
git add (whatever I did)
git commit -m "some_strange_message"
gp (git push -u origin master aaaaaaaaaah pushing to master OMG!!!)
```

and jekyll does the rest of the job... well that's not too hard right? 
It's actually pretty fun! That's how I do my blogging and it's cool!
