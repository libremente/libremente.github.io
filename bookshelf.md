## Past reads
* **The Lean Startup by [*Eric Ries*](http://theleanstartup.com)**.  
  It has been presented to me as ''a must for every wannabe startupper'' so
  I decided to give it a try.
  Eric describes the journey that he embarked on, as a co-founder of IMVU, in
  order to
  ''migrate'' his ideas in a fully-functioning *lean startup*. The book is
  easy to read (took me around a week), it contains several useful insights
  and light case studies that help in the understanding of how an agile
  business can be structured. Furthermore, in the book there are several
  interesting hints that may help also scale-ups or already organized
  industries to embrace the lean movement. The only little drawback that
  I found is that sometimes there are technical terms like ''continuous
  integration'' or ''continuous deployment'' which could be hard to fully
  understand for non-technical readers.
  Overall, it is a pleasant read, particularly indicated not only to first time
  startuppers but also for managers who want to innovate their project
  management techniques inside big corporations. 

* **Il vecchio e il mare by [Ernest Hemingway]**.
  If you have a couple of hours of spare time I invite you to immerse yourself
  in this amazing book. So easy to read, engaging and deep at the same
  time. I guarantee that the genius of Hemingway will capture you and throw you
  in the populated waters around Cuba. As usual, the descriptions of everything
  related to the phishing world are so accurate that it actually feels like
  sailing that boat and, at some point, the struggles of the main character
  feel real. I love how Hemingway can describe everything in such a realistic
  way and I can appreciate this in every book.
