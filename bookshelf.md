## Currently on the go
* **The Lean Startup by [*Eric Ries*](http://theleanstartup.com)**.  
  It has been presented to me as ''a must for every wannabe startupper'' so
  I decided to give it a try.

## Next on the list
* **Crossing the chasm by *Geoffrey A. Moore*.**  
  Another must, still on the shelf...
* **Business Model Generation by *Alex Osterwalder*.**  
  Another classic book in the startup world.
