## Currently on the go
### Technical
* **The Lean Startup by [*Eric Ries*](http://theleanstartup.com)**.  
  It has been presented to me as ''a must for every wannabe startupper'' so
  I decided to give it a try.
* **Next Generation Video Coding and Streaming by *Bing***.  
  Technical read on HEVC and adaptive streaming techniques.

### Non-technical
* **Memorie dal sottosuolo by *Fyodor Dostoyevsky***.



## Next on the list
* **Crossing the chasm by *Geoffrey A. Moore*.**  
  Another must, still on the shelf...
* **Business Model Generation by *Alex Osterwalder*.**  
  Another classic book in the startup world.
