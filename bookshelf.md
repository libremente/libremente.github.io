# <center>My 2020 in books</center>
For 2020 I am planning to read a lot more. 
By reading 50 pages per day during the workweek and 30 per day on the weekends
that averages at around 40pp/day. This means that I should be able to read
around 280pp/week. Estimating to have around 250/book (very conservative
but looking at my shelf this is what I have right now) I should be able to read
more than 50 books in this year. 
In my new year's resolution I set the threshold at 40 but, since I'd like to
stay conservative about it, let's say 35.
Let's see how this goes.

## 2019 - Reads (19)

* **Novecento by *Alessandro Baricco*.**
  Just a must.

* **Prisoners of Geography by *Tim Marshall*.**
  One of the best books about geo-politics. Easy to read, highly
  suggested.

* **Estate Fredda by *Gianrico Carofiglio*.**
  A great novel in Bari.

* **Vita di Adriano Olivetti**

* **The subtle art of not giving a fuck by *Mark Mason*.**

* **Con i piedi nel fango by *Gianrico Carofiglio*.**
  Pleasant read, on politics and ethics. 

* **Ingredienti per una vita di formidabili passioni by *Luis Sepulveda*.**
  What a great book!
  
* **The hard thing about hard things by *Ben Horowitz*.**
  This books offers a new perspective on "how to handle hard things". Very very
  fluent to read, it feels easy to empathize with the author and the reader can
  mostly feel the pain he suffered going through the events that made him one of the
  most influential person in the whole Valley. 

* **Don't Make Me Think by *Steve Krug*.**
  Interesting overview on the usability of web and mobile apps.

* **The power of habit by *Charles Duhigg*.** 
  Easy to read book showing the power of habits. 

* **Pragmatic Programmer by *A. Hunt and D. Thomas*.**
  A nice read, I could extrapolate some insightful techniques that made me
  think. 

* **Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a fantastic future by *Ashlee
  Vance*.**
  Very interesting book on the one and only Elon Musk. Very pleasant to read. 

* **Le Tre del mattino by *Gianrico Carofiglio*.**
  A few hours read. A great fiction, a pleasure to read.

* **Bar Sport by *Stefano Benni*.**
  An Italian comedy. 

* **Zero to One by *Peter Thiel*.**
  Peter Thiel, one of the most interesting figures of the Valley and his book.
  What to say. Peter stresses his vision that creating a monopoly is the only
  way to truly succeed and be able to pay back all the stakeholders who
  invested in the venture. 
  I believe it's an interesting book which exposes
  many lessons learned during his early PayPal adventure and the later ones like,
  e.g., Facebook and Palantir. I would highly recommend this book to all the
  wannabe-founders. Easy to read, quick and full of real world examples of both
  success cases and failures. 

  One last remarkable point: take off your tie if you pitch to Peter, he might
  not even listen to you!


* **Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life...And Maybe the
  World by *William H. McRaven*.**
  Little stories from the personal life of the Admiral during his SEAL career
  can be applied also in our everyday normal life. If you want to change the
  world, always start by making your bed!

* **Blockchain by *Jeff Reed*.**
  Having a general background on the subject I decided to take a look at this
  book since I am more and more interested in the ''smart contracts'' matter. 
  This book, after introducing the concept of the *Blockchain* and the *Ledger*,
  dives deeper in the analysis of one of such systems, called ''Ethereum'' which
  is leveraging the Blockchain but, differently from ''Bitcoins'', makes it
  also possible to write and use ''smart contracts''. The last part of the book
  is dedicated to investment strategies in the
  Ethereum sphere.

  First of all, the book itself is divided into different books, so it should
  better be called a ''collection'' of volumes and this, in my humble opinion,
  does not facilitate the reading experience. 
  
  However, my problem was that I really did not enjoy reading it! It was easy to read,
  it took me around
  half a day to finish but when I closed it I had the feeling that I could have
  invested my time in a better way, which is never a good feeling. It is not
  clear to me which is the
  exact audience the author is trying to target. For non-technical readers
  it is too deep whilst, for the technical savvy ones, the information
  presented are way too scarce. From a software developer point of view, I was
  particularly interested in understanding how to exploit the potential of ''smart
  contracts'' but the author makes a very quick overview of the subject
  without giving any sort of deep insight. 

    
* **The Lean Startup by [*Eric Ries*](http://theleanstartup.com)**.  
  It has been presented to me as ''a must for every wannabe startupper'' so
  I decided to give it a try.
  Eric describes the journey that he embarked on, as a co-founder of IMVU, in
  order to
  ''migrate'' his ideas in a fully-functioning *lean startup*. The book is
  easy to read (took me around a week), it contains several useful insights
  and light case studies that help in the understanding of how an agile
  business can be structured. Furthermore, in the book there are several
  interesting hints that may help also scale-ups or already organized
  industries to embrace the lean movement. The only little drawback that
  I found is that sometimes there are technical terms like ''continuous
  integration'' or ''continuous deployment'' which could be hard to fully
  understand for non-technical readers.
  Overall, it is a pleasant read, particularly indicated not only to first time
  startuppers but also for managers who want to innovate their project
  management techniques inside big corporations. 

* **Il vecchio e il mare by *Ernest Hemingway*.**  
  If you have a couple of hours of spare time I invite you to immerse yourself
  in this amazing book. So easy to read, engaging and deep at the same
  time. I guarantee that the genius of Hemingway will capture you and throw you
  in the populated waters around Cuba. As usual, the descriptions of everything
  related to the phishing world are so accurate that it actually feels like
  sailing that boat and, at some point, the struggles of the main character
  feel real. I love how Hemingway can describe everything in such a realistic
  way and I can appreciate this in every book. 

## Must re-read
  A lot of books, still populating the list...
