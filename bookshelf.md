# <center>My 2017 in books</center>
I read. I love to. A whole lot. I space from deeply technical books to
comedies. This list will probably be more useful for me to keep track of my
reading habits and the pace but if you want some hints you are free to take
a quick look-see ;)

## Currently on the go
### *Technical*
* **Next Generation Video Coding and Streaming by *Bing*.**

  Technical read on HEVC and adaptive streaming techniques.

* **High Performance Browser Networking by *Ilya Grigorik*.**

### *Non-technical*

* **Sapiens by *Yuval Noah Harari*.**

  Looks like fun and deep at the same time. How does the *ads* world work?


## Next on the list
* **Business Model Generation by *Alex Osterwalder*.**  
  Another classic book in the startup world. 

* **Crossing the chasm by *Geoffrey A. Moore*.**  
  Another must, still on the shelf...


## Past reads
* **Zero to One by *Peter Thiel*.**
  Peter Thiel, one of the most interesting figures of the Valley and his book.
  What to say. Peter stresses his vision that creating a monopoly is the only
  way to truly succeed and be able to pay back all the stakeholders who
  invested in the venture. 
  I believe it's an interesting book which exposes
  many lessons learned during his early PayPal adventure and the later ones like,
  e.g., Facebook and Palantir. I would highly recommend this book to all the
  wannabe-founders. Easy to read, quick and full of real world examples of both
  success cases and failures. 

  One last remarkable point: take off your tie if you pitch to Peter, he might
  not even listen to you!


* **Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life...And Maybe the
  World by *William H. McRaven*.**
  Little stories from the personal life of the Admiral during his SEAL career
  can be applied also in our everyday normal life. If you want to change the
  world, always start by making your bed!

* **Blockchain by [*Jeff Reed*]**.
  Having a general background on the subject I decided to take a look at this
  book since I am more and more interested in the ''smart contracts'' matter. 
  This book, after introducing the concept of the *Blockchain* and the *Ledger*,
  dives deeper in the analysis of one of such systems, called ''Ethereum'' which
  is leveraging the Blockchain but, differently from ''Bitcoins'', makes it
  also possible to write and use ''smart contracts''. The last part of the book
  is dedicated to investment strategies in the
  Ethereum sphere.

  First of all, the book itself is divided into different books, so it should
  better be called a ''collection'' of volumes and this, in my humble opinion,
  does not facilitate the reading experience. 
  
  However, my problem was that I really did not enjoy reading it! It was easy to read,
  it took me around
  half a day to finish but when I closed it I had the feeling that I could have
  invested my time in a better way, which is never a good feeling. It is not
  clear to me which is the
  exact audience the author is trying to target. For non-technical readers
  it is too deep whilst, for the technical savvy ones, the information
  presented are way too scarce. From a software developer point of view, I was
  particularly interested in understanding how to exploit the potential of ''smart
  contracts'' but the author makes a very quick overview of the subject
  without giving any sort of deep insight. 

    
* **The Lean Startup by [*Eric Ries*](http://theleanstartup.com)**.  
  It has been presented to me as ''a must for every wannabe startupper'' so
  I decided to give it a try.
  Eric describes the journey that he embarked on, as a co-founder of IMVU, in
  order to
  ''migrate'' his ideas in a fully-functioning *lean startup*. The book is
  easy to read (took me around a week), it contains several useful insights
  and light case studies that help in the understanding of how an agile
  business can be structured. Furthermore, in the book there are several
  interesting hints that may help also scale-ups or already organized
  industries to embrace the lean movement. The only little drawback that
  I found is that sometimes there are technical terms like ''continuous
  integration'' or ''continuous deployment'' which could be hard to fully
  understand for non-technical readers.
  Overall, it is a pleasant read, particularly indicated not only to first time
  startuppers but also for managers who want to innovate their project
  management techniques inside big corporations. 

* **Il vecchio e il mare by *Ernest Hemingway*.**  
  If you have a couple of hours of spare time I invite you to immerse yourself
  in this amazing book. So easy to read, engaging and deep at the same
  time. I guarantee that the genius of Hemingway will capture you and throw you
  in the populated waters around Cuba. As usual, the descriptions of everything
  related to the phishing world are so accurate that it actually feels like
  sailing that boat and, at some point, the struggles of the main character
  feel real. I love how Hemingway can describe everything in such a realistic
  way and I can appreciate this in every book. 

## Must re-read
  A lot of books, still populating the list...
