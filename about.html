This is who I am and what I do... oh no wait... probably I also have to write something right? Vabbè sarà per la prossima volta :)

* Update:
I like to use MarkDown... you know just open my editor wherever I have and drop some lines, then go home, plug the cable, 

```
gg (git status)
git add (whatever I did)
git commit -m "some_strange_message"
gp (git push -u origin master aaaaaaaaaah pushing to master OMG!!!)
```

and jekyll does the rest of the job... well that's not too hard right? It's actually pretty fun!
